APCS2 pd 8, team ChunkySnail (Jessica Wu, Raymond Wu, Alvin Ye), Lab #01: What Does the Data Say?

Hypothesis: We believe that the runtime of quicksort is O(nlogn) <br>
			We believe that the pivot point will not significantly impact the data <br>
			We believe that if the data is arranged so that the pivot point is an extreme, then the method will take a bit longer

Background:

Methology: We used System.nanoTime() in order to measure the time it took for each run of quicksort
