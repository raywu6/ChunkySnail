Lab01 -- What Does the Data Say? <br />
2018-03-13 <br />

## Hypothesis 
* We believe that the runtime of quicksort is O(nlogn) <br>
* We believe that the pivot point will not significantly impact the data <br>
* We believe that if the data is arranged so that the pivot point is an extreme, then the method will take a bit longer <br>

## Background

## Methology:
1. We used System.nanoTime() in order to measure the time it took for each run of quicksort <br>
2. We tested quicksort with arrays from size 10 million to 75 million
3. We SOP'ed the content into a csv file, formatted properly
4. We used Google Sheets to graph the csv file information, but we hand-removed the outliers so the graph is more accurate
